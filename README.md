# Facial_Features_Detection_Using_Python_Numpy_OpenCV
This project has code base for the facial features detection. Features like face, eyes and smile is detected in this program. It uses Anaconda Jupyter distribution system with Python 3, Numpy and OpenCV framework for object detection. It also uses HaarCascade algorithm developed by Viola-Jones in 2001
